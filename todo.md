# todo

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of what this codebase needs for enterprise readiness, organized by priority:

---

## Critical Gaps

### ~~1. Security & Secrets Management~~ ✅

- ~~**Plaintext tokens** in `.tokens.json` — needs encryption at rest~~ — AES-256-GCM encryption via `src/crypto.ts`, keyed by `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- **No secrets vault** — API keys should come from AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or similar, not `.env`
- **No key rotation** mechanism
- **Token file permissions** are default (readable by any local process)

### ~~2. Error Handling & Resilience~~ ✅

- ~~Almost no try-catch, no retries, silent failures throughout~~ — try-catch in all tools and providers
- ~~No exponential backoff for transient Google API failures~~ — `src/retry.ts` with exponential backoff and jitter for 429, 5xx, and network errors
- ~~No circuit breaker pattern for rate limiting~~ — semaphore-based rate limiter in Gmail provider
- **No validation of LLM agent outputs before acting on them**

### 3. ~~Observability (Logging, Metrics, Tracing)~~ ✅

- ~~No structured logging library (needs `pino` or `winston`)~~ — `pino` in `src/logger.ts`
- ~~No request/correlation IDs for multi-step agent operations~~ — `AsyncLocalStorage` context in `src/context.ts`, auto-injected via pino mixin
- ~~No metrics (tool latency, success rates, API call counts)~~ — `src/metrics.ts` with `withMetrics` wrapper on all API providers
- ~~No audit trail for destructive actions (delete, spam, archive)~~ — `src/audit.ts` with requestId correlation

### ~~4. Destructive Operation Safeguards~~ ✅

- ~~`cleanAgent` autonomously deletes/archives/spams emails with zero user confirmation~~ — two-phase confirmation flow: plan → user approval → execute
- ~~No undo/rollback mechanism~~ — `unarchive_email`, `undelete_email`, `unspam_email` tools
- ~~No audit log of what was done and why~~ — enhanced `src/audit.ts` with email metadata (subject, from) and reason for each action

---

## High Priority

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline

- ~~No GitHub Actions, no automated tests on PR, no type-checking gate~~
- ~~No deployment scripts or environment configuration (dev/staging/prod)~~

### 6. Testing Gaps

- Unit tests are solid (good coverage, proper mocks), but:
  - ~~**Zero integration tests** — all APIs are mocked~~
  - **Zero end-to-end tests**
  - No performance/load testing for the rate limiter

### ~~7. Configuration Management~~ ✅

- ~~Hardcoded values everywhere: `localhost:3000`, `"primary"` calendar, `"@default"` task list, thread ID `"666"`~~ — all configurable via env vars
- ~~No environment-based configuration system~~ — `src/config.ts` with Zod validation and defaults
- ~~No config validation at startup~~ — fails fast on missing required vars

### 8. Rate Limiting

- ~~Only Gmail has rate limiting (configurable via `GMAIL_MAX_CONCURRENT`)~~
- ~~Calendar and Tasks APIs have no rate limiting~~
- ~~No backoff strategy — `src/retry.ts` with exponential backoff and jitter~~

---

## Medium Priority

### 9. Code Quality Tooling

- ~~No ESLint config~~
- ~~No Prettier config~~
- ~~No `tsc --noEmit` in CI for type-checking~~

### ~~10. Data Persistence & State~~ ✅

- ~~Conversation history uses in-memory `MemorySaver` — lost on restart~~ — `PostgresSaver` backed by PostgreSQL via `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`
- ~~No database for audit logs or operation history~~ — audit logs written to PostgreSQL `audit_log` table via `src/audit.ts`
- ~~Hardcoded thread ID means no multi-session support~~ — dynamic sessions with `/new`, `/sessions`, `/resume <id>` CLI commands

### 11. Documentation

- ~~No API documentation for the tool interfaces~~
- ~~No threat model or security considerations doc~~
- ~~No deployment guide or runbooks~~
- ~~No incident response procedures~~

### 12. Monitoring & Alerting

- No health checks
- No APM integration (Sentry, Datadog, etc.)
- ~~No usage analytics~~ — every API call is persisted to PostgreSQL `analytics` table via `recordToolCall()` in `src/metrics.ts`; `getAnalytics(since?)` returns per-tool summaries (call counts, success/failure, avg/min/max latency)

## Suggested Roadmap

| Phase | Focus                                                                                        | Status                                              |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Encrypt tokens, add structured logging, add retry logic, add audit trail for destructive ops | ✅ Done                                             |
| **2** | CI/CD pipeline, integration tests, config management, startup validation                     | Partial (config ✅, CI/integration tests remaining) |
| **3** | User confirmation flows for destructive actions, undo/rollback, multi-session support        | ✅ Done                                             |
| **4** | APM/monitoring, security scanning (SAST/dependency), deployment automation                   | Not started                                         |
